Explanation of Files and Folders:**

* `public/index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the React application.
* `src/components/`: This directory contains all the React components used in the application.
    * `App.jsx`: The root component that manages the application's state and renders other components.
    * `Header.jsx`: A simple header component that displays the title of the application.
    * `ToDoList.jsx`: Renders the list of to-do items using the `ToDoItem` component.
    * `ToDoItem.jsx`: Represents a single to-do item and handles its display and interactions.
* `src/index.js`: The entry point for the React application, which renders the `App` component into the DOM.
* `src/index.css`: The main CSS file for styling the application.

**Step-by-Step Guide to Run the Project:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd my-todo-app
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command installs all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

3.  **Start the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command starts the Vite development server. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173/` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

4.  **Open in Browser:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173/`). You should see the To-Do application running.

5.  **Build for Production (Optional):**

    If you want to build the application for production, run:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command creates a `dist` folder containing the optimized production build of your application. You can then deploy the contents of this folder to a web server.

**How to Use the Application:**

* **Adding Tasks:**

    1.  Type the task in the input field.
    2.  Click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.

* **Marking Tasks as Completed:**

    * Click on the task text to toggle its completion status. Completed tasks will have a strikethrough.

* **Deleting Tasks:**

    * Click the "Delete" button next to the task to remove it from the list.

* **Editing Tasks:**

    1.  Click the "Edit" button next to the task.
    2.  Modify the task text in the input field.
    3.  Click the "Save" button to save the changes or "Cancel" to discard them.

**Customization:**

* **Styling:** You can customize the look and feel of the application by modifying the CSS in `src/index.css` or by using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
* **Adding Features:** Feel free to add more features to the application, such as task prioritization, due dates, or local storage to persist data.
